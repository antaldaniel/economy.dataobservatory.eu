In the EU, open data is governed by the [Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019 / 1024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024). It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the [Public Sector Information Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32003L0098), also known as the *PSI Directive* which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013.
