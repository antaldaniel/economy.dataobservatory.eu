`Big data` and `AI` create new inequalities in the world. `Data monopolization` can potentially lead to product and service market monopolization, too.  We are designing new policy indicators that can help competition policy practitioners and researchers to measure and understand these trends.

- We are planning to programatically access the merger database of the European Commission's [Merger Cases](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/index.cfm?clear=1&policy_area_id=2), which we believe to fall under the scope of the Open Data Directive.
- We would like to connect to the [EUIPO](https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/databases) databases to create indicators of potential killer acquisitions - acquisitions by large companies that may thwart innovation by buying up and killing start-up companiees to take hold of competitive patents.
