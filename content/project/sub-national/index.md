Working with sub-national data, on the level of provinces, states, regions, metropolitan areas brings far more insights into climate policies and potential actions than working with national data. The United States is a country, and so is Malta.  China is a country, and so is Qatar. We believe that comparing Sydney Metropolitan Area with Paris Metropolitan Area, West Australia with Asturias in Spain is a far more fruitful approach.

`What?`:  We want to integrate non-European sub-national boundaries, covered by the ISO 3166-2 standard into our [regions](https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/) package, similarly to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) and its sub-natioal maps. 
`Why?`:  We can compare more homogeneous, more similar parts of the world with each other, we can compare social, economic, environmental variables and public opinion change in a far more relevant manner.
`Use cases`:  Understanding how many people need an alternative to living from coal mining.  Political dynamics of accepting climate change policies and individual climate action. 
`Skills needed`: 
`How can you contribute`: 
1. Finding out how can we parse data fairly from the [ISO Online Browsing Platform](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:ZW)
2. Writing the parsing code in R
3. Testing the parsing code in R
4. Writing tutorials
5. Finding ways to connect ISO 3166-2 sub-national boundaries with other sub-national boundaries, such as Europe's NUTS.
