We find it difficult to imagine a path to net zero emissions that includes the use coal as a fuel. We would like to map communities in the world that still depend on coal mining.

Data curated by Milos
 
`What?`:  We put coal mining areas on the global map?
`Why?`:  It allows us to connect coal mining to opinions about climate change and socio-economic indicators of communities.
`Use cases`:  Understanding how many people need an alternative to living from coal mining.  Political dynamics of accepting climate change policies and individual climate action. 
`Skills needed`: Knowing where coal is mined in your country. 
`How can you contribute`: <Milos write this up>
